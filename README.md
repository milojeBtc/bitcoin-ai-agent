## Assumptions & Limitations:
1. The agent responds only in English, even if the user's input is in another language.
2. The agent uses time-based cryptocurrency price caching and rate-limiting(up to 5 mins) to avoid redundant API calls. So, the rates can be
   5 mins old.
3. The translation capability is basic and relies on the LLaMA model's multilingual understanding.
4. No streaming has been included in the code, which means the user will have to wait for the entire response
5. The responses are kept short with the assumption that 100 tokens would be enough for the responses. The number of tokens per word is
   assumed to be 1.5
